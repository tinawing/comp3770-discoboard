We plan to present the instrument, give instructions on how to play it as well as a demo, and then allow the participant (with music background) to play around with it on their own for a period of time (perhaps 10-15 minutes). Reactions and comments will be recorded, and they will then be asked a series of questions in an interview-style setting.
The following indicative sample of questions will make use of both the Likert scale and open-ended responses (e.g. "Please answer on a scale from 1 to 5 and explain your reasoning"):
1. How engaged did you feel when playing this instrument?
2. How hard do you think this instrument is to play or learn? (This question may be asked again in relation to existing instruments, both electronic and non-electronic)
3. Do you think this instrument can engage members of the audience? (Perhaps also in relation to other instruments)
4. How much did you enjoy interacting with the instrument?
5. How frustrated did you feel while interacting with the instrument?
6. Were you able to create a wide variety of sounds?
7. Could you/did you manage to discover any techniques while playing?
