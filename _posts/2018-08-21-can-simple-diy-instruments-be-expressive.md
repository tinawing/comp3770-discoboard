Hey Tina, don't worry about the date in the metadata above (or in the filename).
We'll change that later when we figure out when to release the blog post. But

## The plan

## Where's the code/creativity/culture mix here?

Say something about c/c/c?

## Find out more...

How can people find out more/get involved?
