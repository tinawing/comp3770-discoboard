Hey Tina, don't worry about the date in the metadata above (or in the filename).
We'll change that later when we figure out when to release the blog post. But
you should start writing it in this file.

First, give a one-paragraph overview of your project

## Background

Electronic music has experienced enormous growth in the last decade, and has been around for much longer than that. Few can deny that it has cemented itself in the realm of music recently. This can be seen through the increase prevalence of electronic beats in modern pop music, the newfound popularity of launchpads and music production software, and even performances using exclusively electronic instruments such as the theremin.

While perhaps not the most difficult, electronic music at large is not the most intuitive. This is especially true for those who would like to try engaging with electronic music, rather than become serious producers. My goal is to build an instrument that allows easier, more intuitive expression of electronic music.

## The plan

* Arduino will be used to build the instrument due to the simplicity of its interface, as well as its extensive I/O and sensor options 
* Instrument will most likely focus on gestures (the theremin is gestural as well). The current prototype uses an ultrasonic sensor to change sound based on proximity.
* A user study will be involved, with evaluation based on [NIME](http://www.nime.org/archives/)-style criteria
* The instrument may interact with music produced from live coding software (e.g. Sonic Pi)

## Where's the code/creativity/culture mix here?

My project will facilitate human-computer interaction by exploring creative ways in which the expression of electronic music can be made more intuitive. Although the core of it is still rooted in computer science (Arduino, electronic music), the code/creativity/culture mix comes in with the new ways in which we can express it - we'll see what they turn out to be!

2. If you're interested in the project in general, or have any ideas to help out, please contact me too.
